    <h1> </h1>

    <p1>These triple chocolate chunk cookies might just be the best cookie recipe ever. These cookies are soft and chewy
        and loaded with three kinds of chocolate and toasted almonds.</p1>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Chocolate. I went for the trifecta here and used dark, milk, and white chocolate chunks.</li>
        <li>Almonds. I love toasted almond flavor, but you could swap in a different nut or omit them altogether.</li>
        <li>Butter. Make sure your butter is room temperature.</li>
        <li>Sugar. Using both brown and white sugar gives the best flavor and texture.</li>
        <li>Eggs. Again, make sure your eggs are room temperature.</li>
        <li>Flour. Use some quality all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Baking soda. Using baking soda vs baking powder makes the chewiest cookies.</li>
        <li>Malted milk powder. This is an optional ingredient, but it makes a HUGE difference in the outcome.</li>
        <li></li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Directions</h1>

    <ol>

        <li>Room temperature ingredients. This is so important!
            Make sure your ingredients are at room temperature–the
            butter and eggs emulsify so much better. You want nice,
            fluffy butter so these cookies end up nice and
            chewy.</li>
        <li>Beat your butter and sugar long enough. For the best texture,
            you really need to beat the butter and sugars
            together for 4-5 minutes. The butter mixture should be really
            light, fluffy, and almost doubled in size.
        </li>
        <li>2 sugars are better than 1. There’s a reason why these cookies
            call for both brown and white sugar, so
            please don’t make any substitutions. Brown sugar gives these cookies
            a chewy texture and reacts with the
            baking soda for leavening. The white sugar gives them their crispy edges.</li>
        <li>Don’t use chocolate chips. For best results, buy chocolate bars and
            chop them up. Chocolate chips have
            stabilizers that keep them from melting properly. If you can find
            chocolate feves, those are the way to go!
            If I can’t find them, my go-to is to head to Trader Joe’s
            and buy their Pound Plus bars in white chocolate,
            bittersweet chocolate, and milk chocolate.</li>
